shortDescription: RNA-centric microbiology, mapping DNA–RNA–protein interaction
  networks and non-canonical regulation in bacteria.
description: >
  The DNA & RNA Interaction Lab (d.r.n.a) studies how RNA and DNA interactions
  shape bacterial gene regulation and chromosome organisation. We combine new
  experimental methods with data-driven analysis to uncover non-canonical
  regulatory mechanisms in bacteria.
whatWeDo: >
  We are interested in how RNA and DNA interactions control bacterial gene
  expression and cell physiology. Our focus is on non-coding RNAs, RNA-binding
  proteins and DNA-associated factors that together orchestrate translation,
  stress responses and cellular decisions.


  We study these processes in a range of bacterial systems, with relevance for infection biology, microbiome function and microbial biotechnology.
howWeDoItExperimental: >
  We develop and use methods to capture RNA–RNA, RNA–protein and RNA–DNA
  contacts directly inside cells, and combine these with deep sequencing and
  multi-omics readouts. This allows us to map regulatory interactions at high
  resolution.


  Our work includes bacterial genetics, physiology, stress responses and infection-relevant models.
howWeDoItComputational: >
  We use unsupervised learning and other machine-learning approaches to detect
  structure in large, multidimensional datasets without strong prior
  assumptions. This helps us identify unexpected regulatory modules and
  chromosomal organisations.


  The lab values open, reproducible analysis workflows and close collaboration between experimental and computational team members.
labCulture: >
  We aim to create a kind, inclusive and collaborative environment where people
  feel safe to ask questions, share ideas and discuss challenges. We value
  diversity of backgrounds and perspectives as essential for both good science
  and personal development.
