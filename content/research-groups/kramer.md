shortDescription: Institute-wide mass spectrometry core, supporting microbial omics and quantitative biomolecular analysis.
description: |
  The Mass Spectrometry of Biomolecules group functions as the institute's mass spectrometry core, supporting microbial omics, quantitative proteomics and metabolomics across the Microbiology Theme and other SILS programs.
whatWeDo: We develop and apply advanced MS-based analyses of biomolecules, enabling discovery and quantitative measurements for complex biological questions. The group combines mass spectrometry with biomolecular and organic chemistry to support and advance life-science research across SILS.
howWeDoItExperimental: Through close collaboration with other SILS groups, we integrate MS workflows with chemistry, physics, informatics and biology, and run the SILS MS core facility.
