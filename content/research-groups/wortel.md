shortDescription: Studying how microbial populations adapt and allocate resources, and how constraints shape growth, fitness and coexistence.
description: |
  We study how microbial populations adapt and allocate resources, and how constraints shape growth, fitness and coexistence across environments.
whatWeDo: |
  The lab explores evolutionary and systems biology of microbes, from metabolic strategies to antibiotic resistance dynamics and gut microbiome function.

  We are interested in understanding the fundamental principles that govern microbial adaptation, resource allocation, and population dynamics. Our research spans from single-cell metabolism to complex community interactions, with applications in health, biotechnology and understanding microbial evolution.
howWeDoItExperimental: |
  We combine quantitative experiments with computational modeling and data-driven analysis, and collaborate widely within SILS and beyond.

  Our experimental approaches include chemostat evolution experiments, high-throughput phenotyping, and quantitative measurements of growth and metabolism across different environmental conditions.
howWeDoItComputational: |
  We use computational modeling to understand the constraints and trade-offs that shape microbial physiology and evolution. This includes metabolic modeling, evolutionary simulations, and data-driven analysis of large-scale experimental datasets.

  We integrate theory with experiments to develop predictive models of microbial behavior, from single cells to communities.
