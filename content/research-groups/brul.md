shortDescription: Fundamental and applied microbiology to understand stress physiology, antibiotic action and resistance emergence.
description: |
  We conduct fundamental and applied microbiology to understand stress physiology, antibiotic action and resistance emergence in key species and consortia.
whatWeDo: |
  We investigate microbial stress responses, antimicrobial resistance, spore biology and microbiome-related questions linked to health and food safety.

  Our research spans from understanding fundamental mechanisms of stress adaptation and spore formation to applied questions about antibiotic resistance, food safety, and microbial survival in various environments. We work with model organisms including E. coli, B. subtilis, and yeasts to uncover general principles of microbial physiology.
howWeDoItExperimental: |
  We use molecular biology, quantitative physiology and model organisms (E. coli, B. subtilis, yeasts), in collaboration with partners across Amsterdam.

  Our experimental approaches combine classical microbiology with modern molecular techniques, including genomics, transcriptomics, and advanced imaging to study stress responses and adaptation at multiple scales.
