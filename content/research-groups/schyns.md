shortDescription: Peripheral microbiomes interactions with gut microbiomes and
  host, studying peribiomics axes and their networks.
description: The Peribiome Lab focuses on peripheral (skin, nasal, mouth)
  microbiomes interactions with gut microbiomes and host, studying the so-called
  axes and their network (peribiomics). We set up bilateral physiomimetical
  dynamic models to study molecular signals and spatial biology during the
  dynamic interactions.
whatWeDo: We focus on peripheral (skin, nasal, mouth) microbiomes interactions
  with gut microbiomes and host, to study the so-called axes and their network
  (peribiomics). We investigate spatial biology of microbiome interactions and
  molecular signaling during dynamic host-microbiome interactions.
howWeDoItExperimental: We set up bilateral physiomimetical dynamic models to
  study molecular signals and spatial biology during the dynamic interactions.
  Beyond collaborations with other groups involved in microbiome topics within
  the SILS Microbiology theme, we team up with neuroscience, dermatology,
  internal medicine and the attached clinical experts.
