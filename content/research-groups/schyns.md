shortDescription: Peripheral microbiomes interactions with gut microbiomes and host, studying peribiomics axes and their networks.
description: |
  The Peribiomics Lab focuses on peripheral (skin, nasal, mouth) microbiomes interactions with gut microbiomes and host, studying the so-called axes and their network (peribiomics). We set up bilateral physiomimetical dynamic models to study molecular signals and spatial biology during the dynamic interactions.
