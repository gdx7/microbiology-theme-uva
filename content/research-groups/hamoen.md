shortDescription: Fundamental bacterial cell biology and chromosome dynamics underpinning growth, stress responses and pathogenesis.
description: |
  The Bacterial Cell Biology group focuses on fundamental bacterial cell biology, including chromosome dynamics, cell-cycle control and stress responses that underpin growth, survival and pathogenic potential.
whatWeDo: We study fundamental mechanisms of bacterial cell division and envelope biology, including division machineries, membrane organisation, stress responses and antibiotic-relevant targets.
howWeDoItExperimental: We use genetics and advanced fluorescence microscopy in Bacillus subtilis, combined with quantitative physiology & systems biology approaches.
