shortDescription: Developing experimental systems to probe microbiome interactions with epithelial tissues and immune players.
description: |
  We develop experimental systems to probe microbiome interactions with epithelial tissues and immune players, and explore translational applications with clinical partners.
whatWeDo: |
  The lab studies microbiome–host crosstalk with a focus on gut bacteria, physiology and microphysiological systems (organ-on-chip) to model interfaces and mechanisms.

  We investigate how gut microbiome communities interact with host tissues, particularly epithelial barriers and immune components, to understand fundamental mechanisms of host-microbiome communication and their implications for health and disease.
howWeDoItExperimental: |
  We integrate organ-on-chip models, culture methods for oxygen-sensitive microbes, and multi-omics readouts to reveal mechanisms of host–microbiome communication.

  Our experimental approaches combine advanced microfluidic systems with specialized anaerobic culture techniques, allowing us to recreate physiologically relevant microenvironments and study complex host-microbiome interactions in controlled settings.
