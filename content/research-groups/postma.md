shortDescription: Spatial systems biology studying signal transduction and cell
  polarity regulation in microbial systems.
description: >
  The Spatial SysBio Lab investigates spatial aspects of signal transduction and
  regulation using systems biology approaches, combining molecular biology,
  quantitative imaging and computational modeling to understand cellular
  organization and decision-making processes.
whatWeDo: >
  We investigate spatial aspects of signal transduction pathways, cell polarity
  regulation and membrane organization using systems biology approaches.


  Our research combines molecular biology, quantitative imaging, and computational modeling to understand cellular organization and decision-making processes in microbial systems. We study how spatial organization influences signal transduction and cellular regulation at multiple scales, from molecular interactions to whole-cell behavior.
howWeDoItExperimental: >
  We use advanced imaging techniques and molecular biology tools to study
  spatial organization of signaling pathways and cellular processes.


  Our experimental approaches include quantitative microscopy, genetic manipulation, and biochemical assays to investigate how cells organize their signaling machinery in space and time.
howWeDoItComputational: >
  We develop and apply computational models to understand how spatial
  organization influences cellular behavior. This includes modeling of signaling
  networks, membrane dynamics, and cellular decision-making processes.


  We integrate experimental data with theoretical frameworks to build predictive models of spatial organization and regulation in microbial systems.
