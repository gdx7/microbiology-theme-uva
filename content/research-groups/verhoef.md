shortDescription: Endowed chair connecting microbial food safety research with regulatory practice and national policy.
description: |
  The NVWA Chair on Microbial Food Safety links fundamental and applied microbiology at SILS with Dutch national policy and regulatory practice, strengthening the translation of food safety research into governance.
whatWeDo: We assess and model microbiological risks along food chains to inform public health, surveillance and policy. Special Chair in Microbial Food Safety focusing on the epidemiological determination of microbiological risks in food chains, embedded at SILS and established by the NVWA.
howWeDoItExperimental: We collaborate with national partners and apply quantitative risk assessment, epidemiology and (meta)genomic monitoring.
