shortDescription: Quantitative microbial physiology and biotechnology, using systems and synthetic biology for strain development.
description: |
  The Molecular Microbial Physiology group studies microbial physiology with quantitative and systems approaches, developing next-generation microbial biotechnology platforms and production strains.
whatWeDo: We study how microbes allocate resources and adapt their metabolic programs under different environmental and biotechnological conditions. The group investigates microbial physiology and metabolism in quantitative terms, in the context of systems biology and biotechnology.
howWeDoItExperimental: We combine experimental microbiology with data-driven and modeling approaches, collaborating across the Bacterial Cell Biology & Physiology groups at SILS.
