shortDescription: Human and industrial microbiome research and engineering, targeting health, food and biotechnology applications.
description: |
  The Microbiome Engineering Lab studies how microbiomes influence human health and biotechnological processes, and develops strategies to engineer microbial communities for diagnostics, therapies and sustainable production.
whatWeDo: We investigate host–microbiome crosstalk across life stages and diseases, developing strategies to modulate microbial communities and metabolites to benefit the host. We bridge clinical reality and experimental innovation to study how the gut microbiome functions in health and disease, and how we can engineer it for better outcomes.
howWeDoItExperimental: Using microbiome engineering, ex vivo/in vitro models and multi-omics read-outs, the lab links mechanistic insight to translational opportunities in collaboration with clinical partners.
